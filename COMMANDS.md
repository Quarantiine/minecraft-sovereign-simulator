## 🗡️ 1. The Sovereign Command Scepter

The **Sovereign Command Scepter** is your primary instrument of tactical command. It operates in 3 distinct click profiles:

### A. Quick Tap (Right-Click < 8 ticks)

- **Targeting an Enemy**: Commands all selected squad members to focus-fire that target. Plays a war drum sound and spawns angry villager & crit particles.
- **Targeting the Ground (up to 64 blocks)**: Drops an RTS waypoint marker with a golden beacon beam. Minions march smoothly on the ground, form up in **Ranked Army Lines** facing the objective, and enter the **Unified Stationed** position (`guardAnchorPos` set, `holdingPosition == true`), automatically deselecting so you can issue fresh commands without re-clicking.
- **Targeting an Owned Minion**: Orders that individual minion to toggle between stationed and following. If the minion was stationed (via waypoint ping or close-up right-click), a **single click** immediately orders them to follow without any extra clicks!
- **Aiming into Open Air**: Broadcasts your current mode directive to your entire active squad.
- **In BUILD Mode**: Cycles through your custom blueprint catalog.

### B. Channeled Banner of Courage (Hold Right-Click ≥ 8 ticks)

Channeling projects an expanding **90° forward conical sector** (from 3.0 up to 16.0 blocks) with flame and portal boundary rays:

- **Real-Time Targeting Preview**:
  - Owned minions inside the cone glow with an outline and sparkle with enchant dust.
  - Hostile mobs inside the cone are marked with angry villager and crit target cues.
- **On Release**:
  - **Mass Attack**: If enemy mobs are in the cone, minions automatically distribute targets across the enemy group and charge in a coordinated assault! _(Note: Innocent villagers and iron golems caught in the cone are strictly protected and never attacked)._
  - **Rally & Transfigure**: Minions inside the cone are gathered into your active squad and transfigured into your primed archetype (if selected in the Command Hub).
  - Sounds a deep war horn (`SoundEvents.EVENT_RAID_HORN` / goat horn) and war drum blast.

### C. Shift Modifiers (Sneak + Click)

- **Shift + Right-Click**:
  - Aimed at air/blocks: Cycles your active command mode.
  - Aimed at an owned minion: Opens their **9-slot Inventory and Equipment Screen**.
- **Shift + Left-Click**:
  - In `BUILD` mode: Cycles the structure hologram rotation (0° → 90° → 180° → 270°).
  - In any other mode: Instantly deselects all minions.

---

## 🎛️ 2. Command Modes

Cycle through operating modes using **Shift + Right-Click** or by pressing **`V`** to open the Command Hub:

| Mode          | Visual Theme      | Description & Behavior                                                                                                                   |
| :------------ | :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`FOLLOW`**  | 🟢 Emerald Green  | Selected minions march in disciplined **Ranked Army Lines** behind you. Unselected minions wander freely.                                |
| **`STAY`**    | 🟡 Gold Yellow    | Minions hold position at their current location and guard the immediate perimeter.                                                       |
| **`MINE`**    | 🟠 Blaze Orange   | Anchors full 3D area mining & deconstruction. Minions clear all blocks top-to-bottom with zero air-mining.                               |
| **`BUILD`**   | 🔵 Diamond Cyan   | Activates 3D neon cyan blueprint holograms. Builders construct multiblocks using Arcane Levitation flight.                               |
| **`DESIGN`**  | 🌸 Arcane Magenta | In-world spatial capture: sequential left-clicks (Pos1 → Pos2) with holographic ghost grid block rendering to capture custom blueprints. |
| **`RECRUIT`** | 🟣 Arcane Purple  | Quick-tap living mobs to transfigure them into loyal minions.                                                                            |
| **`PATHWAY`** | 🔷 Deep Aqua      | Place waypoint outlines and assign minions to autonomous patrol routes with 5 unique color channels.                                     |

> [!TIP]
> **No Need for an Attack Mode!**
> Combat is entirely contextual: tap an enemy to focus-fire, or channel the 90° sector to launch a mass coordinated attack on an entire enemy formation!

---

## 🎖️ 3. Squad Channel Management

You can divide your army into **5 distinct tactical channels**:

- **`ALL`** (White / Wildcard): Commands every minion you own regardless of assignment.
- **`ALPHA`** (Red): Primary vanguard strike force.
- **`BRAVO`** (Blue): Flankers and archers.
- **`CHARLIE`** (Green): Logistics, builders, and resource harvesters.
- **`DELTA`** (Purple): Heavy bulwark defenders and sentinels.

To switch squads:

1. Open the Command Hub (**`V`**).
2. Click the squad tab along the top header.
3. Any scepter directive or waypoint ping now applies strictly to minions assigned to that squad!

---

## 🛡️ 4. Visual Pathway Patrol & Minion Escort Hierarchy

### A. Dynamic Custom Hex Colors & Route Channels

Patrol pathways can be customized with arbitrary 24-bit hex colors or selected from built-in channels:

- **Route 1**: 🟡 **Gold / Amber** (`#FFD700`) — Base perimeter & main gates (Default Route).
- **Route 2**: 🔵 **Azure / Cyan** (`#00E5FF`) — Castle battlements & ramparts.
- **Route 3**: 🟢 **Emerald Green** (`#00FF66`) — Farms, village borders & gardens.
- **Route 4**: 🟣 **Arcane Purple** (`#B300FF`) — Nether portals & mine shafts.
- **Route 5**: 🔴 **Crimson Red** (`#FF2244`) — Forward defensive trenches & killzones.
- **Custom Hex Routes**: Create and configure unlimited dynamic routes with custom names and exact RGB hex codes (e.g. `#FF5500`, `#00AAFF`).

### B. Configuring & Designing Routes in the Command Hub & PATHWAY Mode

1. Switch to **`PATHWAY`** mode (**Shift + Right-Click** or in the Command Hub **`V`**).
2. **Paginated Route Dashboard (`V` Menu)**:
   - Browse routes 4 per page with **`[ ◀ Prev ]`** and **`[ Next ▶ ]`** navigation buttons.
   - Click **`[ + New Route ]`** to create a fresh custom patrol route on the fly.
   - Click **`[ Edit ]`** on any route to open the **Patrol Route Configuration Modal** (`PatrolRouteEditModalScreen`):
     - Edit custom display name.
     - Pick from 8 quick preset color swatches (Gold, Cyan, Emerald, Purple, Crimson, Blaze Orange, Royal Blue, Hot Pink) rendered in their vibrant swatch colors with active selection highlight borders, or type an exact hex color (`#RRGGBB` / `0xRRGGBB`) with live preview.
     - Click **`[ ✔ Save Route ]`** to persist across server and world saves.
     - Click **`[ ✖ Delete Route ]`** to safely delete the route; all patrolling minions assigned to that route safely detach (`routeId = -1`) and hold position.
3. **Right-Click Air** to cycle to your desired route channel (e.g. Route 1 Gold).
4. **Right-Click Ground Blocks** along your perimeter:
   - Each clicked block places a waypoint tile resting cleanly **on top of the surface** with a 3D holographic bounding wireframe tinted to the route's exact hex color.
   - An animated numbered billboarding badge hovers above the tile: `[ 1 ]`, `[ 2 ]`, `[ 3 ]`, etc.
   - Luminous 3D laser tether lines float directly on top of the block surface, connecting consecutive waypoints in order.
   - **Zero-Overlap Protection**: A waypoint position can only belong to **one** route channel. You can never accidentally place two route colors on the same block.
   - **Selective Visibility**: Pathway holograms and laser tethers are visible **only** when holding the Command Scepter in **`PATHWAY`** mode. Inactive channels remain vividly colored at 65% opacity, while the active channel pulses brightly with an inner core.
5. **Universal Deleting & Undo**:
   - **Left-Click (Punch) with Scepter**: Attack any placed waypoint block with the Scepter in `PATHWAY` mode to instantly remove it from whichever route channel it belongs to (with smoke particles and bass note sound without breaking the block!).
   - **Right-Click Undo / Removal**: Right-clicking an existing waypoint tile removes it from its route channel, even if your held Scepter is set to a different color channel! It will never place a duplicate waypoint on top.
   - **Sneak + Right-Click**: Sneak-right-clicking an existing waypoint deletes it without popping up the Command Hub GUI screen.
6. Want to start over? **Sneak + Right-Click Air** or click **Clear Route** in the Command Hub GUI (`V`) to clear all waypoints from the active route channel.
7. **Persistent Across Game Reloads**: All routes are automatically stored in world save data (`data/minion_patrol_routes.dat`) and reload seamlessly when joining the world!

### C. Assigning Minions to a Patrol Route

You have three intuitive ways to deploy minions onto a pathway:

1. **Direct Right-Click Without Shifting (Individual or Group Route Assignment)**:
   - Hold the Command Scepter in **`PATHWAY`** mode.
   - Verify that your active route channel matches the one with waypoints (cycle with **Right-Click Air** or check the tooltip/GUI).
   - **Right-Click directly on an owned minion without shifting** (works up-close or aiming at it with crosshairs up to 32m away).
   - **With minions selected**: Assigns all currently selected minions plus the clicked minion to the active route, automatically deselecting them from following you so they begin patrolling immediately!
   - **With 0 minions selected**: Toggles the targeted minion on/off the active route. When assigned, the minion salutes, displays an overhead badge `[ 🟡 Route # ]`, and immediately begins marching along the pathway.
   - _(Note: Shift + Right-Click on an owned minion passes through to open the Minion Inventory GUI screen)._
   - _(Note: Left-Click remains standard selection/punch — use normal Left-Click or 90° cone sweep to select your minions first, then Right-Click to assign them all to the route!)._

2. **90° Forward Sector Sweep (`Shift + Hold Right-Click` in PATHWAY Mode)**:
   - Hold the Command Scepter in **`PATHWAY`** mode.
   - **Shift + Hold Right-Click** for $\ge 0.4\text{s}$ (8 ticks) aiming at your group of minions.
   - An expanding 90° forward arcane sector appears in front of you (growing from 3m to 16m), highlighting all minions inside the arc.
   - **Release Right-Click**: All minions inside the 90° sector are assigned to the active route, burst with celebration particles, and march out together!
   - _(Tip: Normal Hold Right-Click without Shift performs the standard 90° cone sweep to select minions into your squad)._
   - _(Note: Assigning to an empty route with 0 waypoints is prevented with an informative warning)._
   - _(Direct Command Precedence: Interacting with a minion using an empty hand to follow or hold position will immediately unbind it from patrol routes and escort chains)._

3. **Command Hub Mass Squad Dispatch (`V` Menu)**:
   - Press **`V`** to open the Command Hub.
   - Select **`Pathway`** mode.
   - Select your desired **Target Squad Channel** (e.g. `Alpha`, `Bravo`, or `ALL`).
   - Click the **Route Channel** you want to assign them to (e.g. Route 1).
   - Click **Execute Directive** (bottom-left button).
   - All minions in the chosen squad within range are immediately assigned to that route and march out together!

- **Autonomous AI (`MinionPatrolGoal`)**:
  - Minions march sequentially through each tile from first placed `[ 1 ]` to last `[ N ]`.
  - **Smooth Traversal (No Intermediate Stopping)**: Minions continuously march through intermediate pathway tiles without stopping.
  - **End-Only Vigilant Linger**: When reaching the **end** of a pathway (terminal waypoint before reversing in `PING_PONG`, or final waypoint before looping back in `LOOP`), minions halt and perform a **10s–15s (200–300 ticks)** vigilant sentry wait, turning to scan for threats like a watchman.
  - Over terrain variations, minions utilize player-like $1.25\text{D}$ step height and ground pathfinding to seamlessly step over slabs, stairs, and 1-block steps.
  - **Smart Combat & Task Resume (No Horn Sound)**: If hostiles approach, a blueprint is placed nearby, or an ally requires healing, the minion yields patrol duties (Warriors fight, Builders construct, Sentinels heal) without blaring horn audio. Once the combat or task resolves, the minion snaps to the nearest waypoint and seamlessly resumes the patrol cycle! Patrolling minions strictly follow their routes and never return to or follow the commander unless explicitly selected (which cleanly detaches them from their route).

### D. Linear Ping-Pong vs. Closed Loop Patrol (`[ 🔁 / 🏓 ]`)

- **Closed Loop (`LOOP`)**: Checkpoints connect continuously ($1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 1$). Ideal for perimeter walls, moat boundaries, and circular courtyard patrols.
- **Linear Ping-Pong (`PING_PONG`)**: Checkpoints traverse sequentially forward and reverse upon reaching terminal ends ($1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 2 \to 1$). Ideal for linear hallways, trench battle lines, bridge checkpoints, and battlement walks without minions cutting through the middle of the base!
- **Toggling**: Switch mode via the Command Hub (`V` key) Route Dashboard using the `[ 🔁 / 🏓 ]` button.

### E. Patrol Breach Alarm & Mobilization

- When a patrolling sentry detects a hostile mob crossing its route:
  - **Audible Sentry Alarm**: Sounds a deep goat horn blast and resonant raid bell (`ITEM_GOAT_HORN_SOUND_0` / `BLOCK_BELL_USE`).
  - **Visual Alarm**: Emits angry villager particles above the sentry's head.
  - **Allied Mobilization**: Instantly alerts all nearby allied minions within a **16-block radius**, calling them to break idling and converge on the breach to eliminate the intruder!

### F. Minion Escort Hierarchy (Squad Leaders & Bodyguards)

You can command minions to escort and protect another minion in two seamless ways:

#### Method 1: Shift-Punch to Designate Squad Leader (Instant Escort Assignment)

1. **Select Minions**: Left-click (punch without Shift) or use the 90° cone sweep (`Hold Right-Click`) to select one or more minions (even in **PATHWAY** mode) so they are selected and following you (e.g. two Sentinels).
2. **Shift + Punch the Leader Minion**: While holding the Command Scepter, **Shift + Left-Click (Shift + Punch)** the minion you want them to escort (e.g. a frontline Warrior).
3. **Automatic Deselection & Mutual Exclusivity**:
   - The punched minion becomes the **Squad Leader**!
   - All selected minions are immediately tethered to escort that leader.
   - All assigned escort minions are **automatically deselected from you** (`setSelected(false)`). They cannot follow you and will exclusively follow their squad leader.
   - **Self-Follow Safeguard**: The leader minion cannot follow itself. If it was already following you, it remains following you as point-man while the other minions fall into escort formation around it.
   - A resonant chime sounds (`BLOCK_NOTE_BLOCK_CHIME` & `BLOCK_AMETHYST_BLOCK_RESONATE`) and celebratory particles burst!

#### Method 2: Scepter Escort Priming

1. Hold the Command Scepter with 0 minions selected and **Shift + Left-Click** an unassigned minion.
   - HUD: _"🛡 Sentinel primed as Escort! Right-click another minion to assign as Leader."_
2. **Right-Click** the leader minion.
   - The follower is automatically deselected from you and tethers to the leader!

#### Escort Formations & Dedicated Leader Defense:

- **Escort Arcane Tether Beam**: Holding the Command Scepter renders a luminous cyan-to-magenta particle vector beam streaming from the escort to their squad leader.
- **Dynamic Army Formation Ranks (Any Squad Size)**:
  - **No Matter the Squad Size**: Whether 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 minions escort a squad leader, every escort dynamically computes a unique, non-overlapping battle rank station.
  - **Role-Based Tactical Layout**:
    - **Sentinels**: Flank on lateral shoulders and outer wings ($\pm 1.35\text{D}$ to $\pm 3.60\text{D}$, $+1.8\text{D}$ forward), casting _Aegis of Restoration_ whenever their leader drops below 70% HP.
    - **Warriors**: Form frontline shock lines ($+4.0\text{D}$ forward, $-2.0\text{D}$ per subsequent row), screening their leader in battle.
    - **Builders & Miners**: Guard the rear support column ($-2.0\text{D}$ rearward).
  - **Surface & Ground Navigation**: Automatically resolves walkable surface elevation (`resolveWalkableY`) and navigates terrain with player-like $1.25\text{D}$ step height.
  - **Companion Catch-Up Teleport**: If separated from the leader by $>24$ blocks, or navigationally stuck for $\ge 40$ ticks ($2.0\text{s}$) while $>10$ blocks away, escorts immediately teleport to their squad leader with ender portal particles.
- **Dedicated Squad Leader Combat AI**:
  - **Defends the Leader, Not the Master**: Escorts automatically attack whoever damages their squad leader (`TrackLeaderAttackerGoal`) and coordinate attacks on whatever their leader attacks (`AttackWithLeaderGoal`), completely ignoring distant player skirmishes.
  - **16-Block Combat Leash**: If an enemy tries to lure an escort more than 16 blocks away from the squad leader, the escort breaks aggro and sprints back to formation.
  - **Post-Combat Regrouping**: Upon clearing combat targets, escorts sprint directly back to their squad leader at $1.35\text{D}$ speed, never returning to the player.
  - **Wander & Stray Suppression**: Idle wandering (`WanderAroundFarGoal`) and stationary waypoint holding are suppressed while escorting.
- **Automatic Detachment Upon Following You**:
  - If a minion is escorting another minion and you order it to follow you (via **normal punch / Left-Click**, **90° Cone Sweep**, or **empty-hand right-click**), it **automatically detaches** from that minion (`clearLeader()`) and joins your following squad!
  - You can also **Shift + Left-Click (Shift-Punch)** an escort minion with 0 minions selected to dissolve its escort bond directly (`Escort cleared; minion follows master.`).
  - Mass squad follow commands and normal panic retreats (`R`) preserve escort bonds; only **Emergency Citadel Call (`Shift + R`)** unbinds all escorts fortress-wide.

### G. Overhead Badge Status Indicators

Minions display real-time tactical overhead badges above their heads:

- `[ 🟡 Route 1 ]` / `[ 🔵 Route 2 ]`: Indicates active patrol channel assignment (only visible when the assigned route has active waypoints).
- `[ 🛡 Escort ]`: Indicates the minion is tethered to a squad leader as a dedicated bodyguard.
- `[ ⚙ AUTO: <Role> ]`: Indicates an autonomous agent displaying its currently adapted dynamic role (`Warrior`, `Sentinel`, or `Builder`).

## 🖥️ 4. The Command Hub Screen (Keybind `V`)

Press **`V`** with a scepter anywhere in your inventory to open the tactical command screen:

- **Squad Tabs**: Filter orders by `ALL`, `ALPHA`, `BRAVO`, `CHARLIE`, or `DELTA`.
- **Mode Bar**: Direct buttons for `FOLLOW`, `STAY`, `MINE`, `BUILD`, `RECRUIT`, and `PATHWAY`.
- **4-Role Archetype Bar**: Select an active role (`⚔ Warrior`, `🛡 Sentinel`, `🏗 Builder`, `⚙ AUTO`). When primed, your next **Banner of Courage** rally transfigures all gathered minions into this archetype!
- **Patrol Route Dashboard (in `PATHWAY` Mode)**:
  - Defaults to **Route 1 (Channel 1 🟡 Gold)** automatically upon switching to `PATHWAY` mode or opening the hub in `PATHWAY` mode, syncing immediately with the held Scepter stack.
  - Displays 5 route channel selection rows (`Route 1` through `Route 5`) with live waypoint counters (`[ 4 pts ]`).
  - Active channel is marked with `§e✦`.
  - **`[ 🔁 / 🏓 ]` Patrol Mode Toggle**: Instant one-click switching between **Closed Loop** ($1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 1$) and **Linear Ping-Pong** ($1 \to 2 \to 3 \to 2 \to 1$).
  - **`[ ✕ ]` Quick Clear**: Instantly purges all waypoints from the chosen channel.
- **Blueprint Browser (in `BUILD` Mode)**: Browse multiblock structure blueprints, view required resources, and project 3D wireframe holograms.
- **Deconstruction & Mining Modes (in `MINE` Mode)**: Toggle between **`[ ⛏ Direct ]`** (instant point-and-click structure/ground dismantle) and **`[ 🔲 Custom Area ]`** (configurable 3D boundary box quarrying with sequential corners `Pos1`/`Pos2`, live height adjustment, `[ ⛏ Confirm Area ]` modal opener, and `[ ⌫ Reset ]`).
- **`[ ⚔ Targets ]` Minion Target Filter (always visible, under the mode grid)**: Opens a modal listing every hostile mob (spawn-egg icon, name, and checkbox) in a scrollable grid. Checked mobs are attacked **on sight** by your **`AUTO`**, **`SENTINEL`**, and **`WARRIOR`** minions; unchecked mobs are left alone. Use **`[ ✔ Select All ]`** / **`[ ✖ Clear All ]`** for bulk changes, then **`[ ✔ Submit ]`** (or `Enter`) to save or **`[ ✖ Cancel ]`** (or `Esc`) to discard. The filter is saved per player in the world and applies to all your minions. Defaults match legacy behavior (slimes, magma cubes, ghasts, phantoms, shulkers, hoglins, and the Ender Dragon start unchecked). Retaliation against attackers, owner/leader assist targeting, and explicit scepter target pings are never blocked by the filter. `AUTO` minions also ignore unchecked mobs when deciding whether to morph into `WARRIOR`.

## 🏛️ 6. Building Structures (`BUILD` Mode)

1. Select **`BUILD`** mode (**Shift + Right-Click** or press **`V`**).
2. **Arcane Build Flight (Free Survival Flight & Water Safety)**:
   - When in `BUILD` mode, you automatically enter physical Arcane Flight in both Survival and Creative modes.
   - **Free 3D Survival Flight**: Enjoy unconstrained, responsive 3D vanilla flight mechanics in Survival mode. Ascend with **`Space`**, descend with **`Shift`**, and glide freely in any direction with WASD without rigid altitude clamping or velocity locks.
   - **Water Flight Cancellation Safeguard**: If you fly over water or submerge while in `BUILD` mode, the scepter instantly cancels all active construction sessions, switches mode automatically to **`FOLLOW`**, revokes flight abilities, plays an extinguishing hiss, emits splash particles, and displays a warning (`§c⚠ Construction cancelled: Flying over water is prohibited in BUILD mode!§r`).
   - **Cave & Indoor Clearance**: Upward raycasts automatically detect overhead cavern or room ceilings to prevent clipping into low terrain.
   - **Safe Descent**: Exiting `BUILD` mode, switching hotbar items, or descending to land gently restores normal ground physics with complete fall damage immunity.
   - **Tactical Zoom**: Press **`H`** to cycle zoom presets (`0.75x`, `1.0x`, `1.5x`, `2.0x`) or hold **`Ctrl` + Scroll** for fine zooming without hotbar conflicts.
3. **Real-Time Per-Block Ghost Dissolution & Wireframe Hologram**:
   - As builder minions place each block into the structure, that specific wireframe box dissolves immediately from the hologram view.
   - When the final block is placed, the ghost grid clears completely, triumphant fanfare particles play, and minions disengage flight to return to their commander or hold their post.
   - Semantic color coding highlights components:
     - **Doors**: 🟢 Emerald Green (`#00FF88`, full 2-block portal outline).
     - **Lights & Torches**: 🟡 Amber Gold (`#FFCC00`).
     - **Utilities & Beds**: 🟣 Arcane Purple (`#9933FF`).
     - **Walls & Columns**: 🔵 Diamond Cyan (`#00D4FF`).
     - **Roof Trim & Eaves**: ❄️ Ice Blue (`#70B8FF`).
4. **Command Hub GUI (`V` Key)**:
   - **Active Construction Directives**: When **`BUILD`** mode is active, the Command Hub displays active directives confirming that minions construct 100% exact captured blocks without procedural alteration.
   - **Custom Blueprint Viewport**: Clean 3-slot catalog displaying user-authored blueprints with dimensions, block counts, and **Live BOM Readiness Badges** (`§a✔100%`, `§6X%`, `§c0%`), complete with `◀` / `▶` pagination and `Page X/Y` indicators.
   - **Material Bill of Materials (BOM) & Resource Estimator**: Click the **`[ 📋 BOM ]`** button to open the live inventory delta modal.
   - **Rotation Controls**: Click the **`[ ↻ X° ]`** button to rotate the blueprint 90° clockwise.
5. **📋 Material Bill of Materials (BOM) & Live Resource Estimator**:
   - **Multiplayer & Survival Authoritative Sync**: Dispatches C2S/S2C packets (`RequestResourceEstimationPayload` & `SyncResourceEstimationPayload`) calculating real-time inventory deltas across both the commander's bag and all nearby allied minion backpacks within 64m.
   - **Zero-Latency Offline Fallback**: Features an instant client-side calculation fallback (`ClientResourceEstimatorTracker`) that renders immediately while awaiting network packet confirmation.
   - **Smart Builder Harvestability Tagging**: Categorizes deficient items into autonomously harvestable (`§6⚒ Auto (-X)`) for materials builder minions can quarry, smelt, cultivate, or synthesize versus manual procurement (`§c✕ Need (-X)`).
   - **Category Pill Tallies**: Displays at-a-glance status pills for 🪨 Stone & Masonry, 🪵 Timber & Wood, 🪟 Glass & Details, and 🌿 Organic/Misc materials.
   - **Capped Contribution Math**: Prevents a surplus of one item (e.g. 500 cobblestone) from masking shortages of another (e.g. 0 oak planks) in the overall readiness percentage.
   - **Survival Placement Actionbar Delta**: When right-clicking to anchor in Survival mode, displays an instant actionbar update (`§6📋 BOM Delta: §a✔ 100% Ready` or `§eX% Ready (Y/Z blocks in bags & N minions)`).
   - **Tactical Battlefield Awareness**: Suppresses background blur shader (`applyBlur` override) so you can keep full visual awareness of surrounding minions, hostile threats, and terrain while inspecting the modal.
6. **100% Exact Block Fidelity**:
   - Minions place every block (stairs, slabs, glass, lanterns, masonry, containers) in the exact position, orientation, and block type captured in **`DESIGN`** mode.
   - Retired legacy architecture styles, biome substitutions, procedural size scaling, and noise weathering to ensure full player creative fidelity.
7. **Rotate Blueprint (3 Ways)**:
   - **Press `R`**: Directly rotates the hologram 90° clockwise (0° → 90° → 180° → 270°).
   - **Left-Click** _(with Scepter in `BUILD` Mode)_: Directly rotates the hologram 90° clockwise (works aiming at air, terrain, or blocks, with or without Shift).
   - **Command Hub GUI (`V`)**: Click the **`[ ↻ Rotate ]`** button inside the Command Hub screen.
   - **Flight Altitude Control**: While hovering in Arcane Build Flight, hold **`Space`** to ascend or **`Shift`** to descend to your ideal vantage height.
8. **Right-Click** on any ground block to anchor the construction session:
   - **100% Pixel-Perfect Crosshair Alignment**: A camera-aligned raycast ensures the hologram and placement anchor match exactly where your screen crosshair points on the terrain, even from high-altitude bird's-eye views (up to 96m reach).
   - **One-Click Aerial Placement**: Instantly transmits placement packets to the server so you can drop foundations without descending to the ground.
   - **Sky Tap to Cycle**: Right-clicking into empty air or open sky cycles to the next blueprint in your catalog.
9. Assigned **Builder** minions will activate **3D Arcane Levitation**, flying up to each layer and completing the structure bottom-to-top:
   - **Builder Block Phasing (`noClip = true`) & Zero Drift**: Builders can pass through blocks **strictly and only** while actively building or evacuating a finished structure. They fly directly through floors, walls, and ceilings in 3D straight to their work stations without getting trapped indoors or drifting towards exterior exits.
   - **Persistent Zero-Timeout Execution**: Builders never halt, give up, or freeze near the end of a build. The artificial 400-tick timeout loop and failure pauses have been completely eliminated. Builders poll tasks continuously and work without interruption until 100% of the structure is finished.
   - **Arcane Phase-Shift Resolution**: If interior detail blocks (like anvils, grindstones, blast furnaces, chests, or hanging lanterns) are enclosed by newly constructed walls or ceilings, builders do not get stuck. After 40 ticks (~2 seconds) of obstacle obstruction, they perform an **Arcane Phase-Shift**—teleporting directly to their work station with purple portal runes and SFX to place the block cleanly.
   - **Post-Construction Structure Egress**: Upon finishing a building, builders do NOT get trapped inside. They retain block phasing (`noClip = true`) and fly smoothly out of the building to the exterior perimeter. Normal collision physics are only restored once the builder is safely outside with clear headroom.
   - **360° Perimeter Waypoints & Guaranteed Flank Spread**: When construction completes with no further blueprints in the vicinity, golden beacon beams (`END_ROD` + `GLOW`) and chime audio rise around the finished build, distributed evenly across all flanks (South/Front, East Flank, North/Back, West Flank) so minions completely encircle the structure instead of stacking in one spot. Builders are teleported directly to their assigned flank station, safely positioned outside the structure, and stationed on guard at attention (`isSitting = true`, `guardAnchor` set) regardless of squad assignment.
   - **Autonomous Blueprint Chaining & Vicinity Transition**: If you place down additional blueprints in the builders' vicinity ($\le 128$ blocks) while they are working on a build or stationed, they automatically and immediately transition to the next placed blueprint upon finishing the current structure. They never enter sitting or sleeping states when active blueprints exist nearby, seamlessly moving from build to build across your base or fortress!
   - **Autonomous Stationed Mobilization**: When you place a new blueprint down nearby (within 112–128 blocks horizontally and vertically), stationed builder minions automatically wake up (`setSitting = false`) and mobilize to build immediately without requiring you to walk over and re-select them—easily reaching across mega structure construction sites! A single right-click on any stationed builder still commands them to follow if desired.
   - **Creative Mode**: Builders place blocks freely at zero material cost. Any existing blocks (grass, flowers, snow, dirt) are automatically pre-cleared with zero dropped items, eliminating all clutter.
   - **Survival Mode**: Builders resolve construction materials through a multi-stage logistics pipeline (Backpack → Local Containers → Peer Sharing → Autonomous Quarrying/Timber → Mob Hunting Contracts).

## ⛏️ 7. Mining & Area Clearance (`MINE` Mode)

The **`MINE`** mode features two distinct operational sub-modes for excavation and deconstruction: **`DIRECT`** (Structure / Point Dismantle) and **`AREA`** (Custom Boundary / Box Quarry Mining). You can toggle between these modes inside the Command Hub GUI (**`V`** key) or via scepter controls.

```
                                  [MINE Operating Mode]
                                            │
                    ┌───────────────────────┴───────────────────────┐
                    ▼                                               ▼
         [DIRECT Sub-Mode]                               [AREA Sub-Mode]
   • Instant point-and-click dismantle             • Configurable 3D boundary volume
   • Anchors directly at clicked position          • Sequential Left-Clicks: Pos1 ➔ Pos2
   • 96m crosshair reach                           • Fiery orange/amber ghost grid wireframes
   • Dismantles structures or ground               • Real-time height adjustment (Ctrl + Scroll)
   • No boundary setup required                    • Dedicated Confirmation Modal before mining
```

### A. DIRECT Mining Mode (Point & Structure Dismantle)

1. Select **`MINE`** mode with **`DIRECT`** sub-mode active.
2. Aim at the structure, ground block, or terrain you want to clear to see a **Fiery Orange/Red 3D Wireframe Preview** anchored directly on the clicked block (up to 96m reach).
3. **Right-Click** on the ground/block to initiate the dismantle session immediately.
4. Assigned **Builder** minions immediately take flight with 3D Arcane Levitation and excavate all solid, destructible blocks top-to-bottom.

### B. AREA Mining Mode (Configurable 3D Boundary & Box Quarry Mining)

The **`AREA`** mining mode allows commanders to define exact 3D excavation boundaries in the world, inspect block counts, adjust vertical depth/height in real time, and confirm mining operations via a dedicated modal:

1. **Sequential Left-Click Corner Selection**:
   - **1st Left-Click (Corner 1 / `Pos1`)**: Sets `Pos1` anchored on the targeted block surface adhering to the Unified Surface Anchoring Contract. A vibrant fiery orange anchor marker illuminates, sparkle particles burst, a note block chime sounds, and the action bar confirms `✦ Mining Pos1: [X, Y, Z]`.
   - **Aiming Candidate Preview**: Aiming around the world dynamically renders an expanding candidate bounding wireframe and live ghost grid block outlines from `Pos1` to your crosshair.
   - **2nd Left-Click (Corner 2 / `Pos2`)**: Sets `Pos2` on the opposite diagonal, completing the 3D volume footprint. Sparkle particles erupt, resonant chime audio plays, and the full fiery orange/amber (`1.0F, 0.45F, 0.05F`) 3D bounding wireframe and non-air block ghost grid outlines illuminate.
   - **Subsequent Left-Clicks (Cycle)**: Left-clicking again automatically starts a new selection cycle (`Pos1` updated, `Pos2` cleared).
   - **Shift + Left-Click (Reset)**: Instantly clears both `Pos1` and `Pos2` with a bass tone, guaranteeing the very next click places `Pos1` afresh.
2. **In-World Real-Time Height Adjustment**:
   - Hold **`Ctrl` + Mouse Scroll** (or use **`[`** / **`]`** or **`PageUp`** / **`PageDown`** keys) to expand or contract the excavation height in real time without placing temporary blocks (hold **`Shift`** for $\pm 5$ fast stepping).
   - HUD actionbar displays live height updates and total bounding dimensions.
3. **Mining Area Confirmation Modal (`MiningConfirmModalScreen`)**:
   - Once `Pos1` and `Pos2` are set, **Right-Click** on the ground/air or click **`[ ⛏ Confirm Area ]`** in the Command Hub GUI to open the **Mining Confirmation Modal**.
   - **Modal Inspection Details**:
     - Displays `Pos1` and `Pos2` corner coordinates.
     - Displays Width $\times$ Height $\times$ Depth dimensions and total volume in voxels.
     - **Destructible Block Counter**: Analyzes and displays the exact count of destructible, non-air blocks within the boundary (excluding unbreakable bedrock).
     - **Dedicated Height Stepper Row**: Fine-tune the excavation height directly inside the modal with **`[ -5 ]`**, **`[ -1 ]`**, **`[ +1 ]`**, and **`[ +5 ]`** buttons placed in a dedicated row cleanly isolated from modal title and spatial text, preventing visual overlap.
   - **Modal Actions**:
     - **`[ ✔ Start Mining ]`**: Dispatches `StartMiningAreaPayload` to the server, clears the client selection, plays horn & chime fanfare, and starts the top-down excavation session.
     - **`[ ⌫ Reset ]`**: Wipes `Pos1` and `Pos2` selection corners.
     - **`[ ✖ Cancel ]`**: Closes the modal without starting excavation, keeping your corner selection intact.
     - **Crisp Overlay**: Completely bypasses background blur (`applyBlur` no-op) to preserve 100% battlefield situational awareness.

### C. Minion Excavation & Safety Systems (Both Modes)

Assigned **Builder** minions mobilize autonomously to execute the mining operation:

- **Full Selected Area Clearance**: Builders mine **every** solid, destructible block within the selected volume from the highest Y level down to the lowest Y level.
- **Zero Air-Mining Guarantee**: Builders strictly never claim, navigate to, or swing pickaxes at air blocks. If a block was destroyed or already air, minions instantly advance to the next real block without swinging or vocalizing.
- **Anti-Bobbing Mining Flight**: Miners utilize the exact same Arcane Levitation flight as builders during mining. Minions fly to a stable elevated station at `targetY + 1.25D`, maintain zero gravity and zero vertical velocity oscillation, and freeze velocity (`0.0D`) during mining swings, never falling into trenches when mining blocks beneath them.
- **Mining Completion Perimeter Teleportation & Hold Position**: When all mining tasks are complete, miners receive identical post-completion treatment as builders:
  - Teleported directly to assigned perimeter waypoints along the rim of the quarry (`baseY = box.getMaxY() + 1`) or ground footprint.
  - Golden beacon beams (`END_ROD` + `GLOW`) and chime audio fanfare (`SoundEvents.BLOCK_AMETHYST_BLOCK_CHIME`) play at each perimeter station.
  - Placed into defensive hold position (`sitting = true`, `guardAnchorPos` assigned, `selected = false`), guarding the rim without wandering or following uncommanded.
- **Bedrock & Indestructible Immunity**: Bedrock and indestructible blocks (negative hardness) are strictly protected and never targeted.
- **Survival Direct Collection & Chest Storage vs. Creative Zero-Drop**: In Survival mode, broken blocks are collected directly into the builder's backpack (`drop = false`). When backpacks fill or sessions finish, builders deposit 100% of excess/surplus materials into nearby chests (within 24 blocks) or craft/deploy autonomous chests, leaving zero dropped items on the ground. In Creative mode, blocks are cleared cleanly without entity drops or chests to completely eliminate world clutter.
- **Automatic Wireframe Dismissal**: The moment the entire selected area is cleared (all blocks in the volume become air or indestructible), the session finishes with celebratory particles and sound, and the highlighted wireframe **immediately disappears**!

## 🧙‍♂️ 8. 100% Universal Arcane Levitation & Obstacle Vaulting

- **100% Zero-Footprint Traversal Across All Roles**: Warriors, Sentinels, and Builders traverse ravines, scale cliffs, navigate vertical terrain, and descend structures using zero-footprint 3D Arcane Levitation with zero ephemeral block generation.
- **Universal Indoor Navigation Safeguards & Door Auto-Opening**:
  - **Ceiling Raycast & Anti-Wedging (`hasCeilingAboveMinion`)**: In indoor rooms or beneath low ceilings ($Y+2 \to Y+4$), upward levitation is suppressed, forcing standard ground navigation to prevent head-wedging or continuous flight stalls.
  - **Ground-First Step Priority**: Elevation changes with $\Delta Y \le 1.25\text{D}$ are traversed on foot using enhanced $1.25\text{D}$ step-height before 3D levitation is triggered, ensuring seamless transitions across interior thresholds, slabs, and stairs without jumping or floating.
  - **Universal Door Traversal (`autoOpenNearbyDoors`)**: Minions across all roles automatically open closed non-iron wooden doors and gates within 1.5 blocks along their movement paths, enabling smooth traversal through doorways without pathing stalls.
- **Builder Kinematics Isolation**:
  - Builders maintain isolated 3D flight control throughout construction and deconstruction tasks (`activelyBuilding || exitingBuilding`), preventing universal travel levitation forces from conflicting with hover stationing, block phasing, or structure egress.
- **Builders**: Maintain permanent 3D flight throughout construction and deconstruction tasks, hovering adjacent to work blocks at any height without scaffolding or temporary blocks.
- **All Minion Types (Warriors, Sentinels, Builders)**:
  - **Strict 2-Condition Levitation**: Levitation activates ONLY when facing obstacles $\ge 2$ blocks high or holes/chasms $\ge 1$ block long (drop $\ge 2$ blocks deep). For all other blocks (stairs, slabs, carpets, 1-block steps), minions walk around or step over them like a player.
- **Dynamic Obstacle Clearance & Solid Ground Landing**: Minions can scale obstacles of any height (3, 5, 10, or 20+ blocks high) without artificial altitude caps or premature timers. Upward lift carries minions cleanly over barriers, and the instant a minion's feet reach solid ground without a taller obstacle ahead (e.g. stepping atop a 3-block ledge or reaching the other side), levitation deactivates immediately and restores normal gravity, ground walking, and step height (1.25D). In mid-air, downward glide carries minions to earth. Melee warriors in ground combat never launch into the air.
- **Formation Follow Anti-Jitter**: Allied minions suppress mutual physical collision shoving (`pushAwayFrom`) when idle, guarding, or standing in formation ranks. Consistent walkable ground elevation checks and arrival velocity zeroing eliminate endless station-hunting jitter.
- **Operational Leash Freedom**: Stationed and held minions enjoy an expanded **128-block leash**, while unselected free workers have simulation-chunk freedom without snap-teleporting to players while working on active construction sessions.
- **Panic Retreat (`R` key)**: Instantly dismisses all 3D holographic wireframes, cancels active construction sessions for the commander, clears combat targets, and recalls all minions to formation.

## 🔔 9. Dual-Tier Panic Retreat & Emergency Citadel Call (Keybind `R`)

The mod provides two tiers of tactical emergency recall:

### A. Quick `R`: Tactical Squad Retreat

Press **`R`** at any time while holding the Command Scepter (or with it in your inventory):

- **Selective Recall (Selected Only)**: Only retreats minions that are currently **selected**. Minions currently stationed in **hold position** (sitting or stationed at guard anchors) are strictly preserved and will **not** retreat.
- **Rely on `FOLLOW` for Held Minions**: To mobilize and recall minions from hold position, switch to or trigger the **`FOLLOW`** command mode.
- **Range**: Recalls active selected squad thralls within **64 blocks**.
- **Combat Disengage**: Immediately clears combat targets on retreating minions (`setTarget(null)`).
- **Preserve Stationed Defense**: Leaves stationary guard posts and perimeter defenses undisturbed.
- **Wireframe Dismissal**: Instantly dismisses all 3D holographic wireframes and cancels active construction sessions for the commander.
- **Sprint Regroup**: Selected minions sprint back at 1.50x speed and reassemble into **Ranked Army Lines** behind you.
- **Audio/Visual**: Sounds a warning retreat bell (`SoundEvents.BLOCK_BELL_USE`), bursts campfire smoke particles, and displays action bar confirmation.

### B. `Shift + R`: Emergency Citadel Call (Fortress Muster)

Press **`Shift + R`** when an all-out emergency threatens your citadel:

- **Expanded Range**: Fortress-wide recall encompassing all owned minions within **128 blocks**!
- **Patrol & Escort Unbinding**: Unbinds **all minions from patrol duty** (`patrolRouteId = -1`) and **unlinks all escort bodyguards** (`clearLeader()`).
- **Stationing Override**: Overrides any sitting or holding postures regardless of squad channel.
- **All-Out Sentry Alert**: Sounds a piercing **Raid Horn** and clanging **Iron Bell** (`ITEM_GOAT_HORN_SOUND_0` / `BLOCK_BELL_USE`).
- **Dramatic Visuals**: Emits large bursts of smoke and purple nether portal particles.
- **Full Fortress Rally**: Every thrall drops what they are doing and sprints to the commander's defense!
- **HUD Alert**: Displays an urgent action bar banner: `§c🚨 CITADEL CALL! All 128m units abandoning posts and rallying to commander!§r`.

## 🎮 10. Survival vs. Creative Mode Mechanics

The commander's active game mode directly affects how minions handle resources, construction, demolition, and interactions:

| Gameplay Mechanic                      | Survival Mode (`/gamemode survival`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Creative Mode (`/gamemode creative`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| **Structure Construction (`BUILD`)**   | **Autonomous Logistics, Harvesting & Procurement**: Builders consume carried blocks, scavenge nearby chests within 12 blocks, transfer blocks via peer-to-peer beams from allies within 24m, autonomously quarry natural stone/deepslate, and harvest timber via bone-meal agro-forestry. When mob resources (wool, bones, slime, leather, etc.) are needed, builders commission nearby Warriors on tactical hunting contracts with automatic material synthesis. They self-craft replacement tools, collect deconstruction drops directly into inventory, and deposit 100% of excess materials into nearby or autonomous chests upon session completion, leaving zero dropped items. (Only pauses with alert if non-harvestable materials are missing). | **Zero-Cost Free Placement & Zero-Drop Guarantee**: Builders construct instantly and infinitely at zero material cost without needing blocks in their inventory or nearby chests. Unneeded blocks are discarded directly from inventory slots (`inv.setStack(slot, ItemStack.EMPTY)`). Multi-part blocks (tall grass, flowers, beds, doors) are cleanly pre-cleared with zero dropped items, and post-session sweeps purge stray item entities within the bounding box, leaving zero dropped items on the ground. |
| **Area Mining & Dismantling (`MINE`)** | **Direct Backpack Collection & Chest Logistics**: Broken blocks are collected directly into builder backpacks (`drop = false`) instead of scattering onto the ground. When inventory fills or sessions finish, builders offload 100% of mined resources into nearby chests (up to 24 blocks) or craft and deploy autonomous supply chests. Only drops on the ground as an absolute fallback if no chest exists and no wood is available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Zero-Drop Demolition**: Blocks are cleared cleanly without spawning entity drops or requiring chests, preventing world and inventory clutter during large excavations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
