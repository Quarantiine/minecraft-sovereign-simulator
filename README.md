## 🎮 Player & Commander Guide

### The 4 Minion Archetypes

Minions are tameable, persistent humanoid thralls equipped with backpacks, equipment inventories, dynamic overhead hearts indicators, and specialized tactical AI routines.

```
       [⚔ WARRIOR]                  [🛡 SENTINEL]                  [🔨 BUILDER]                  [⚙ AUTO]
  Frontline Melee & Thrown      Perimeter Guard & Medic       Architect, Quarry & Logistics   Autonomous Adaptive AI
```

1. **⚔ Warrior (`MinionRole.WARRIOR`)**:
   - **Frontline Combatant & Hunter**: Masters swords, axes, maces, bows, and crossbows.
   - **Trident Duality**: Throws piercing tridents at long range ($5\text{D}\text{--}20\text{D}$) and seamlessly transitions into deadly close-quarters melee thrusts ($\le 5\text{D}$) with server-side loyalty retrieval.
   - **Tactical Ordnance**: Wields throwable TNT Sticks and cryogenic Frost Grenades.
   - **Procurement Contracts**: Automatically accepts hunting commissions from Builders to hunt mob resources (wool, bones, slime, leather) and delivers them through peer-to-peer logistics.

2. **🛡 Sentinel (`MinionRole.SENTINEL`)**:
   - **Perimeter Guard & Combat Medic**: Guards designated anchor posts with an 8-block perimeter and 128-block leash, prioritizing shields in offhand.
   - **Aegis of Restoration**: Autonomously channels healing beams to wounded player commanders, allied minions, and friendly **Iron Golems** under 70% HP within 10 blocks (restoring 6.0 HP + Regeneration II for 5s with heart VFX and amethyst resonance).
   - **Warrior Combat Dual-Mode**: Sentinels fight aggressively like Warriors (active hostile target scanning, melee charge at $1.35\text{D}$, and ranged weapon skirmishing) **strictly when all nearby minions, Iron Golems, and commanders need zero healing** (100% full health). The instant an ally takes damage, the Sentinel disengages immediately (`setTarget(null)`) to prioritize medical protection.

3. **🔨 Builder (`MinionRole.BUILDER`)**:
   - **Master Architect & Demolition Specialist**: Autonomously constructs captured blueprints, deconstructs designated volumes, and quarries stone top-to-bottom.
   - **Builder Block Phasing (`noClip`)**: Seamlessly passes through blocks while building or evacuating structures, preventing entombment and wall-trapping.
   - **Logistics Autonomy**: Agro-forestry timber harvesting (using bone meal for instant sapling maturation), tool self-crafting, supply depot chest drops, and peer-to-peer wireless block transfers.
   - **Perimeter Stationing**: Automatically circles finished structures across all 4 flanks, deploying defensive waypoints with fanfare beams and chimes.

4. **⚙ Auto (`MinionRole.AUTO`)**:
   - **The Default Dynamic Archetype**: Newly summoned or recruited minions start in `AUTO` mode, evaluating their tactical environment every second:
     - Morphs to **Sentinel** if an ally drops below 70% HP or when holding a guard post.
     - Morphs to **Warrior** if hostile mobs enter 16m or when escorting during peacetime.
     - Morphs to **Builder** if an active blueprint or quarry task requires engineering hands.

### Core Strategic Systems

- **The Sovereign Command Scepter**:
  - Handheld tactical conduit supporting 64-block raycast targeting.
  - Left-Click to select/deselect individual units or hold for 90° cone mass sweeps.
  - Right-Click the ground to deploy military waypoint lines.
- **Ranked Army Battle Formations**:
  - Minions automatically calculate disciplined, parallel 4-unit battle ranks: Warriors form the vanguard frontline ($+4.0\text{D}$), Sentinels form the protective midline escort ($+1.8\text{D}$), and Builders bring up the rear support ($ -2.0\text{D}$).
- **Minion Escort Hierarchy & Squad Leaders**:
  - Delegate minions to bodyguard fellow minions. Shift-Punch an owned minion with the Scepter to designate a **Squad Leader**; all selected escorts dynamically form protective flanking ranks around their leader with active cyan-to-magenta Arcane Tether Beams.
- **Custom In-World Blueprint Capture ('DESIGN' Mode)**:
  - Select two corners with left-clicks to enclose any building in a 3D holographic ghost prism.
  - Adjust height in real time with `Ctrl` + Scroll.
  - Name and save the structure directly to world data without destroying the original building. Minion builders can then replicate it anywhere with 100% exact block fidelity!
- **Visual Pathway Patrols**:
  - Script custom patrol loops or ping-pong routes with glowing checkpoint badges (`[ 1 ]`, `[ 2 ]`) and luminous laser vector tethers.
  - Customize routes with 5 built-in channels or 24-bit RGB hex colors via the interactive modal GUI.
- **Dual-Tier Panic Retreat**:
  - Press **`R`** to immediately recall active squad members within 64m.
  - Press **`Shift + R`** for an army-wide **Emergency Citadel Call** (128m), sounding war horns and tolling fortress bells to sprint all stationed units to the commander's defense.
- **Survival Progression & Crafting Recipes**:
  - **Sovereign Command Scepter**: Crafted with 2 Gold Ingots, 1 Amethyst Shard, and 2 Blaze Rods (or Sticks) in a crafting table.
  - **Minion Spawn Egg**: Crafted shapelessly with 1 Egg, 1 Amethyst Shard, 1 Emerald, and 1 Gold Ingot.
  - **Tactical Ordnance**: Craft TNT Sticks (TNT + Stick) and cryogenic Frost Grenades (Ice / Snowball + Stick).
  - **Enthrallment in Survival**: Alternatively, switch the scepter to `RECRUIT` mode and right-click living vanilla mobs (zombies, skeletons, villagers, etc.) to transfigure them into minion thralls!

### Installation Guide for Players

1. Install **Minecraft: Java Edition (1.21)** via the official launcher.
2. Install **Fabric Loader** ($\ge 0.16.0$) from [fabricmc.net](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/).
3. Download the matching **Fabric API (1.21)** from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) or [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).
4. Drop both the **Fabric API JAR** and the **Sovereign mod JAR** into your `.minecraft/mods` folder:
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\.minecraft\mods\`
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods/`
   - **Linux**: `~/.minecraft/mods/`
5. Select the **fabric-loader-1.21** profile in the Minecraft launcher and launch the game!

> **Tip for Multi-Version Setups**: If you run multiple Minecraft versions (e.g., 1.21 alongside other versions or snapshots), configure each launcher installation with a dedicated "Game Directory" (such as `.minecraft/instances/1.21/`). This guarantees that 1.21 Fabric mods remain isolated and cannot cause class loader conflicts or crashes when launching other versions.

```

---

### Local Development Setup

#### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 21+** (required for Minecraft 1.21). Check with `java -version`.
- **Git** installed on your system.
- Modern IDE: **IntelliJ IDEA** (strongly recommended with Minecraft Development plugin) or **VS Code**.

#### Clone & Initialize

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/minecraft-modding.git
cd minecraft-modding
```

---

### Compiling & Running

All builds and runtime tasks are managed via the included Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`):

```bash
# Launch the Loom sandboxed Minecraft client with hot-reload and Yarn mappings
./gradlew runClient

# Launch a standalone dedicated server for network/multiplayer debugging
./gradlew runServer

# Run the complete automated test suite (537 tests)
./gradlew test

# Compile and package the production mod JAR (outputs to build/libs/)
./gradlew build
```

---

### Publishing & Releases

To bump the version, commit, build, and publish a GitHub release with the compiled mod `.jar` in a single command:

```bash
VERSION="1.1.0"
TITLE="v${VERSION} - Title"
NOTES="Description here..."

sed -i '' "s/^mod_version=.*/mod_version=${VERSION}/" gradle.properties && \
git add gradle.properties && \
git commit -m "chore: bump version to ${VERSION}" && \
git push && \
./gradlew build && \
gh release create "v${VERSION}" "build/libs/fabric-mmcli-agent-modding-${VERSION}.jar" \
  --title "${TITLE}" \
  --notes "${NOTES}"
```

---

### Writing Addons & API Usage

Sovereign explicitly permits independent third-party mods to compile against its public interfaces:

- **Querying Minion Archetypes**: Access `minion.getRole()`, `minion.getEffectiveRole()`, and `minion.matchesRole(MinionRole.X)`.
- **Interrogating Healing Status**: Query `minion.hasNearbyAlliesNeedingHealing(radius)` to evaluate squad medical status.
- **Teammate Integration**: `MinionEntity.isAlliedTeammate(Entity other)` seamlessly respects allied minions, owners, and non-hostile Iron Golems without overriding final methods.
- **Listening to Construction Events**: Hook into `ConstructionManager.getInstance()` to track blueprint start, progress, and completion callbacks.

---

### Automated Testing & Invariants

We maintain an extensive automated unit and invariant test suite located in `src/test/java/com/example/`. Tests execute in headless Java without launching a full graphical client:

- **Entity & AI Goals**: `SentinelHealGoalTest`, `MinionFormationAndEquipTest`, `MinionSquadAndRoleTest`
- **Logistics & Harvesting**: `MinionLogisticsAndHarvestingTest`, `MinionAntiJitterAndLevitationSafetyTest`
- **Construction & Dismantling**: `StructureDismantlingTest`, `BedrockAndCeilingSafeguardTest`
- **Ordnance & Physics**: `FrostGrenadeTest`
- **Recipes & Multi-Version Compatibility**: `ModRecipeJsonValidationTest`, `CommandScepterTooltipAndComponentsTest`, `FabricVersionPredicateTest`

Always verify that the entire suite passes cleanly before submitting contributions:

```bash
./gradlew test --rerun-tasks
```
